              Endless Industries is a start-up project at TU Berlin, 
              which successfully received "EXIST Forschungstransfer" funding. 
              Using the patented core technology, we produce fiber composites using
              the FDM printing process and are currently developing an exciting
              product for the orthopedic industry. We want to help
              manufacturing companies to automate their fiber composite
              production by providing printing systems and the right material for
              the job.
