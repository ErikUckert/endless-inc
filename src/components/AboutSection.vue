                Endless Industries is a start-up project at TU Berlin, which
                successfully received "EXIST Forschungstransfer" funding. Using
                the patented core technology, we produce fiber composites using
                the FDM printing process and are currently developing an
                exciting product for the orthopedic industry. We want to help
                manufacturing companies to automate their fiber composite
                production by providing printing systems and the right material
                for the job.
